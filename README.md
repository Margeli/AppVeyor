In this article we will talk about how to avoid making builts manually in GitHub everytime a Release is made to be tested.
So, our objective, is to have an automated process that every time a commit in our code is done, a built of it is published in our repository in GitHub, including all the needed files.
To achieve it, we will be using an external application, AppVeyor. Following this guide step by step we will understand how AppVeyor works and how to configure it to obtain our desired results.
